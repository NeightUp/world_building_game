# world_building_game
***NOTE: This is a work in progress.  Code is not "show ready" so don't judge me for the bits that don't make sense***

A program to build a procedurally generated, hex based game map in python with pygame.  
Requires the pygame, and perlin_noise libraries to run.

map.png is an image file that is created (or saved over) every time you run the code and generate a new map.
It is so you can look at the map as an image without needing to scroll around the map while the code is running.
