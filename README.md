# world_building_game
***NOTE: This is a work in progress.  Code is not "show ready" so don't judge me for the bits that don't make sense***

A program to build a procedurally generated, hex based game map in python with pygame.  
Requires the pygame, and perlin_noise libraries to run.

When you run the code, it will create an image file called map.png.  
This will be created every time a new map is generated.  
If one already exists, it will overwrite the previous version with the new version.
It is so you can look at the map as an image without needing to scroll around the map while the code is running.
