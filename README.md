# world_building_game
***NOTE: This is a work in progress.  Code is not "show ready" so don't judge me for the bits that don't make sense***

A program to build a procedurally generated, hex based game map in python with pygame.  
Requires the pygame, and perlin_noise libraries to run.

***This currently only saves what is initially drawn to the screen***
When you run the code, it will create an image file called map.png.  
This will be created every time a new map is generated.  
If one already exists, it will overwrite the previous version with the new version.
It is so you can look at the map as an image due to no controls having been implemented at the time of upload.
I have found it handy to have, so you can run and close the program, then check the image to see the full output.
useful for quickly dialing in changes to how the map is generated, or how the terrain is assigned.
